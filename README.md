# UNSW_Datathon_2018
This is my personal approach to UNSW_Datathon_2018, a kaggle-like machine learnign competition.
The task is to predict book readers' ratings on their recently purchased books.
Source data is a description of readers' consideration on some of their purchased books and the contents of the books (e.g. genre and vectorized words).
The result ranked 11th out of 50 registered teams.
The score of the models is half based on MSE prediction results and half on analysis (shown on presentation).
